# Block 1 — Foundations (Months 1–4)

## Overview
This block covers the foundational preparation for Electrical Engineering prior to university, with emphasis on **mathematical understanding**, **signal intuition**, and **engineering-style thinking**.

The objective is to build depth and intuition, not exam-oriented memorization.

---

## Objectives
- Develop strong intuition for calculus concepts used in engineering
- Understand electrical quantities as time-varying signals
- Learn to visualize and reason about systems mathematically
- Build habits of structured problem-solving

---

## Topics Covered

### Mathematics
- Limits and continuity  
- One-sided limits  
- Derivatives and their physical meaning  
- Introduction to integration  
- Complex numbers (rectangular and polar form)

### Engineering Intuition
- Signals as functions of time  
- Rate of change in electrical quantities  
- Stability and convergence  
- Left-hand vs right-hand system behavior  

---

## Tools Used
- **MATLAB** — numerical experiments and visualization  
- **MIT OpenCourseWare** — core instruction  
- **Stewart Calculus** — problem-solving practice  
- **Desmos** — graphical intuition  

---

## Skills Developed
- Translating mathematics into engineering meaning  
- Visualizing abstract concepts  
- Solving problems systematically  
- Writing concise technical explanations  
- Thinking in systems rather than isolated equations
